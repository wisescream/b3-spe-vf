# Project Progress Log: T-Pot Implementation by Rayane Ibn Atik, Hassan Basli, and Sadki Amine

This document outlines the key phases and milestones achieved by our group (Rayane Ibn Atik, Hassan Basli, and Sadki Amine) during our project focused on the T-Pot honeypot system and its SIEM capabilities.

## Phase 1: Project Initiation and System Setup
- Defined project goals and objectives.
- Researched T-Pot system requirements and architecture.
- Successfully installed the base Linux OS and then the T-Pot platform on our virtual machine.
- Initial verification of T-Pot services, including honeypots and the Elastic Stack.

## Phase 2: Familiarization with SIEM Stack and Honeypots
- Explored Kibana dashboards to understand data visualization capabilities.
- Learned how Logstash processes and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.
- Identified the various non-AI honeypots active in our T-Pot instance (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea, Elasticpot) and the types of data they collect.
- Began basic data analysis and filtering in Kibana.

## Phase 3: Data Collection and Active Monitoring
- Monitored the system over a period of [e.g., X weeks] to collect attack data.
- Practiced querying Elasticsearch data via Kibana to identify trends and specific events.
- Documented common attack vectors observed, such as SSH brute-force attempts and web scanning.

## Phase 4: Analysis and Reporting
- Analyzed collected data to identify key findings (as noted in our main report).
- Documented challenges faced during the project and the solutions implemented.
- Compiled our learnings and prepared the final project report and this progress log.
